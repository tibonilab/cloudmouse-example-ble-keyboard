/**
 * CloudMouse SDK - Bluetooth Manager
 *
 * Network layer abstraction for BLE connection management.
 * Handles BLE stack initialization, pairing, and connection lifecycle.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This is ONLY the connection layer!
 * For application functionality (sending keys, media commands), use getBleKeyboard() to access the BleKeyboard instance.
 *
 * Features:
 * - BLE stack initialization and lifecycle management
 * - Automatic pairing and connection handling
 * - Event-driven state machine for connection lifecycle
 * - Exposes BleKeyboard instance for application layer
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Network Layer: BluetoothManager (connection only)
 * - Application Layer: BleKeyboard instance (commands, keys, media)
 * - Similar pattern to WiFiManager exposing WiFi class
 *
 * State Machine:
 * IDLE → INITIALIZING → ADVERTISING → CONNECTED (success path)
 *                    ↘ DISCONNECTED (connection lost)
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Create instance and call init() during system startup
 * 2. Call update() regularly in main loop for state monitoring
 * 3. Use getBleKeyboard() to access BleKeyboard for application commands
 * 4. Monitor connection state via isConnected()
 *
 * Example:
 *   BluetoothManager bt;
 *   bt.init();
 *
 *   if (bt.isConnected()) {
 *       bt.getBleKeyboard()->write(KEY_MEDIA_VOLUME_UP);
 *   }
